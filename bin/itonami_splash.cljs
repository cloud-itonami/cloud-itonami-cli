;; itonami splash — the start screen an argless `itonami` opens on
;; (ADR-2609062240), as a harness PLUGIN (ADR-2609042200).
;;
;; ## Why this file exists
;;
;; `itonami` with no arguments printed eight lines of help and exited. Every
;; other agent CLI on this machine — claude, hermes-agent — opens its REPL
;; instead and names, on that first screen, what it can actually do. The help
;; text this replaces had already begun claiming the REPL ("itonami — chat
;; REPL を開く") while `-main` still exited on an empty argv: the screen and
;; the code disagreed, and the screen was the one that lied.
;;
;; ## What it is allowed to say
;;
;; Every line is read from something: the command tables, the resolved profile
;; and its source, the keychain, and one measured `/health`. Nothing is
;; asserted that was not looked up. A start screen that says "connected"
;; without having asked is the sixth of CLAUDE.md's seven questions — a check
;; that could not run must not return the value of a check that ran and
;; passed — so `:server` has three states here, not two: answering, refused,
;; and not measured.
;;
;; ## Width
;;
;; The frame is aligned with `display-width`, which counts East Asian Wide and
;; Fullwidth as two columns and everything else — box drawing and block
;; elements included, which UAX#11 calls Ambiguous — as one. That is what a
;; terminal in a Latin locale does. Warnings print BELOW the frame, where a
;; glyph whose width a terminal disagrees about cannot push a border off.
