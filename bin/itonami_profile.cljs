;; itonami profile layers as harness plugins (ADR-2609042200 Decision 2).
;;
;; The shipped profile (`default`) is an ordered three-layer composition:
;;
;;   itonami.config → :ctx/config   install path, EDN reader, configuration
;;   itonami.theme  → :ctx/theme    skin engine (hermes parity keys)
;;   itonami.chat   → :ctx/chat     slash registry, REPL state
;;
;; Layer replacement is a later plugin with the same :provides key — the
;; dsh patch shape. /skin is the worked example: it re-provides :ctx/theme
;; live, without remounting the layers above or below it.

  The registry is the ONE decider for slash commands: an entry carries its own
  name, argument hint, description and handler, and `/help` is GENERATED from
  it. The shape is hermes's `COMMAND_REGISTRY` (hermes_cli/commands.py).

  This replaced a `case` in `bin/itonami` that dispatched, plus a registry of
  no-op wrappers that only listed -- two views of one thing, and the listing
  was the one that could quietly go stale. It had: `/help` printed a literal
  block that did not mention `/help`.

  Handlers receive [args ctx] and return:
    :exit      the REPL ends
    :handled   the REPL re-prompts
    :resend    the REPL re-submits `last-input` as a message (/retry, /prompt)
    a Promise  the REPL awaits it, then re-prompts
    nil        not a command; the line goes to the agent

  The REPL also keeps its display preferences here (`/verbose`,
  `/timestamps`) and the last line the operator sent (`/retry`)."
